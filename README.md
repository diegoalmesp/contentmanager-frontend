# Web Content Manager - frontend

This is a project for fun, at least for now...

It's a web application to serve content to webpages using services. So, that way, you can separate content from code and manage it from another "place".

This project uses:

- ES6
- ReactJS
- React Router V4 (more info here)
- Jest
- Redux
- Thunk
- Axios
- Bootstrap
- Reactstrap
... and more in the near future!
